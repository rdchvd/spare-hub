# Windows (PowerShell)
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

## Code style and pre-commit

This repository enforces consistent code style and best practices using Black (formatter), Ruff (linter and import sorter), and pre-commit hooks.

### One-time setup
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Run checks and auto-fixes locally
```bash
# Run all hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Or run specific tools directly
black .
ruff check --fix .
```

Conventions enforced:
- Double quotes for strings where possible (Ruff Q rules)
- Imports sorted consistently (Ruff isort)
- Trailing whitespace trimmed and a newline at end of file
- Line length formatted by Black at 88; Ruff E501 (line-too-long) is ignored to allow long constants/URLs
- Black-compatible formatting and various lint checks
